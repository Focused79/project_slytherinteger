With the MLB being a soft cap league most fans just want their teams to spend more money in the hopes of having a more successful team. When saber metrics and data driven analytics were introduced, the hope was that those concepts would even out the playing field for teams that were not as well financially resourced. At the start of this project, we wanted to know if the application of saber metrics would lead to competitive equality. We hypothesized that if teams that were spending less could apply saber metrics and data analysis then they would be able to compete with teams that were traditionally big spenders on a more equal level. As we analyzed our data of offensive and defensive categories versus team salaries we came to a different conclusion. Although there are outliersâ€™ teams that spend more tend to have greater success despite saber metrics and analytics. While there might have been a short period of time when smaller market teams that applied the moneyball theory were able to compete the overwhelming trend continues to be that teams that spend more continue to perform better. 

In conclusion, while we thought that saber metrics would change the level of competition for teams spending less unfortunately it appears that once the league figured out how to apply the saber metrics and analytics the teams that could spend more performed better. Our data shows that despite having some success of saber metric application in the long run teams that have bigger budgets can just continue to outspend and outperform smaller market teams.
